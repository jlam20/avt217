    <p class="about">Dauphine's Revival's story began in 2016 when Kyle Girard and Dylan Lee first met and instantly connected on a vision and sound they were both striving toward. Since then, they’ve been able put their distinct, 80s-inspired spin on official remixes. They released their debut album in 2017, establishing their own unique color under melodic and pop EDM. Dauphine’s Revival rally around a youthful sentiment crafted by dreamers, believers and late-night rebels. In a world that prides itself on being more connected than ever, the same cannot be said about its people who tuck their fears, doubts and insecurities under the covers. Dauphine’s Revival are rewriting the script, encouraging people to be comfortable with their story.</p>
